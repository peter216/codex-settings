Codex note: Converted from a GitHub Copilot prompt. Invoke with /prompts:ac-prompt-my-issues.

Search the current repo (using #githubRepo for the repo info) and list any issues you find (using #list_issues) that are assigned to me.

Suggest issues that I might want to focus on based on their age, the amount of comments, and their status (open/closed).
